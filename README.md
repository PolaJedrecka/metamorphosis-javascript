## Story

We have a great idea: programming is really fun but breeding frogs and butterflies is even more fun! :)

So the decision is made, we want to start a new business line with some fancy frogs and beautiful butterflies. However we are not sure about the process, so **we need your help**. Can you create a small game where we can practice the correct metamorphosis order of these creatures?

## About the project
In this project I had to implement drag and drop events logic using JavaScript. Other than that, the task was to improve using HTML data attributes and CSS styling skills.
